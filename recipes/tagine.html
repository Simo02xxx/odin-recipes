        <h2>Description:</h2>
            A classic dish, this Moroccan chicken tagine gets tons of flavor <br>
            from preserved lemons, olives, and onions. It can be cooked on <br>
            the stovetop in an authentic tagine or roasted in a baking pan in <br>
            the oven, depending on what equipment you have at your <br>
            disposal. Either way, you'll enjoy a delicious meal that is sure to <br>
            please everyone at the dinner table.
        <h2>Ingredients You'll Need to Make This Tagine:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Preserved lemons:</strong> Lemons preserved in salt add brightness <br>
                to this dish and you really can't replicate their pickled flavor <br>
                with lemon juice or zest. You can easily make <em>preserved</em> <br>
                lemons at home, or you can buy them at well stocked <br>
                grocery stores, as well as at specialty shops and online.</li>
            <li> <strong>Smen:</strong> Smen is a preserved butter that has a somewhat <br>
                cheesy flavor. It's optional for this recipe, but helps give the <br>
                tagine its authentic flavor. It's easy to make at home, <br>
                although it has to sit for at least a month. You can also buy <br>
                it in specialty stores and online—Zamouri Spices is one <br>
                source.</li>
            <li> <strong>Ras el hanout:</strong> While no two versions of the Moroccan spice <br>
                blend ras el hanout are exactly the same, it typically <br>
                includes cardamom, nutmeg, anise, mace, cinnamon, ginger, <br>
                various peppers, and turmeric. This recipe calls for a <br>
                homemade ras el hanout, but you can also experiment with <br>
                the blends available from various brands.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 to 2 preserved lemons, quartered and seeds removed</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces, skin removed, back <br>
                discarded or reserved for another use (or an equivalent mix <br>
                of chicken parts)</li>
            <li>2 large white or yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 small handful fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small handful fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon turmeric (or 1/4 teaspoon Moroccan yellow <br>
                colorant)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled, optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smen, optional</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ras el hanout, optional</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 handfuls pitted olives (green, red, or mixed)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water, approximately, if using a tagine</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps;</h2>
        <h3>Marinate the Chicken:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Remove the flesh from the preserved lemons and chop the <br>
                flesh finely. Reserve rind for cooking.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon flesh to a bowl along with the chicken, <br>
                onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, ginger, pepper, turmeric, and <br>
                salt. If using, add the saffron, ras el hanout, and smen. Mix <br>
                well.</li>
            <li>If time allows, let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator <br>
                for several hours or overnight before cooking in either a <br>
                tagine or in the oven. (See below for more information on <br>
                both methods.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking in a Tagine:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add enough of the olive oil to the tagine to coat the <br>
                bottom.</li>
            <li>Arrange the marinated chicken in the tagine, skin side up, <br>
                and distribute the onions all around.</li>
            <li>Add the olives and reserved rind of the preserved lemons, <br>
                and drizzle the remaining olive oil over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Add the water to the tagine, cover, and place on a heat <br>
                diffuser over medium-low heat. Give the tagine time to <br>
                reach a simmer without peeking. If you don't hear the <br>
                tagine simmering within 20 minutes, slightly increase the <br>
                heat, and then use the lowest heat setting required for <br>
                maintaining a gentle—not rapid—simmer.</li>
            <li>Allow the chicken to cook undisturbed for 80 to 90 <br>
                minutes, and then turn the chicken over so it's flesh-side <br>
                up. Cover the tagine again, and allow the chicken to finish <br>
                cooking until very tender (about 45 minutes to 1 hour).</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, and let the tagine cool for about 10 to 15 <br>
                minutes before serving. Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking in the Oven:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 F. Add enough of the olive oil to a <br>
                large baking dish so it coats the bottom.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onions and garlic from the marinade.</li>
            <li>Then place the marinated chicken on top.</li>
            <li>Add the olives and reserved rind of the preserved lemons <br>
                on top and drizzle the chicken with the remaining olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake the chicken uncovered for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or <br>
                until the chicken is light golden brown, basting <br>
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to 350 F and continue baking for another <br>
                20 to 30 minutes or longer. The chicken should be deeply <br>
                browned and the juices should run clear.</li>
            <li>
                Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 10 to <br>
                15 minutes before serving. Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
