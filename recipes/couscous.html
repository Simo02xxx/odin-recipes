        <h2>Description:</h2>
        This outstanding recipe for classic Casablanca-style couscous<br>
        features <strong>steamed couscous</strong> piled high with stewed meat and<br>
        vegetables. (You can omit the meat for a vegetarian couscous.)<br>
        Feel free to vary the vegetables to your family's preferences, but<br>
        try to include a full variety to achieve an authentically flavored<br>
        sauce. It's become increasingly popular in recent years to<br>
        garnish this dish with a generous topping of <em>tfaya</em>, a caramelized<br>
        onion and raisin mixture that can also adorn couscous all on its<br>
        own.
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>For the Meat:</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>Make the Meat:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix the meat, onion, tomatoes, oil, and spices in the</p>
                <p>bottom of a couscoussier. Cook uncovered over medium to</p>
                <p>medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15</p>
                <p>minutes, or until the meat is browned and the onions and</p>
                <p>tomatoes have formed a thick sauce.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the water, the parsley/cilantro bouquet, and the</p>
                <p>chickpeas, if using. Cover, and bring to a boil over high</p>
                <p>heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer rapidly for</p>
                <p>25 to 30 minutes. (If omitting both meat and chickpeas,</p>
                <p>simmer for just a few minutes.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>First Steaming of Couscous:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <p>While the meat is cooking, get the couscous ready for its</p>
                <p>first steaming. Oil the steamer basket and set it aside.</p>
                <p>Empty the dry couscous into a very large bowl, and work in</p>
                <p>the vegetable oil with your hands, tossing the couscous</p>
                <p>and rubbing it between your palms. (This will help prevent</p>
                <p>the couscous grains from clumping together.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Work in 1 cup of water in the same manner, using your</p>
                <p>hands to evenly distribute the liquid into the couscous.</p>
                <p>Transfer the couscous to the oiled steamer basket.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the cabbage to the meat mixture, and place the</p>
                <p>steamer basket on top (seal the joint if necessary). Once</p>
                <p>you see steam rising from the couscous, steam the</p>
                <p>couscous for 15 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour the couscous back into the large bowl and break it</p>
                <p>apart.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the couscous has cooled enough to handle, gradually</p>
                <p>work in 2 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of salt with your</p>
                <p>hands. Again, toss the couscous and rub it between your</p>
                <p>palms to break up any balls or clumps. Transfer the</p>
                <p>couscous back into the steamer, taking care not to pack or</p>
                <p>compress the couscous.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Second Steaming of Couscous:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the turnips, carrots, tomatoes, onions, and fava beans</p>
                <p>(if using) to the pot. Place the steamer basket on top of the</p>
                <p>couscoussier (seal the joint if necessary), and steam the</p>
                <p>couscous a second time for 15 minutes, timing from when</p>
                <p>you see the steam rising from the couscous.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the couscous has steamed for 15 to 20 minutes, turn</p>
                <p>it out into the large bowl again. Break it apart, and let cool</p>
                <p>a few minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you're serving the couscous with jalapeño peppers,</p>
                <p>simmer the peppers, covered, in a half-ladle of broth and a</p>
                <p>little water, for about 40 minutes, or until the jalapeños are</p>
                <p>tender. (The peppers are typically placed on top of the</p>
                <p>couscous, and small pieces may be broken off as a</p>
                <p>condiment.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Third Steaming of Couscous:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Gradually work 3 cups of water into the couscous with your</p>
                <p>hands, tossing it and rubbing the grains between your</p>
                <p>palms. Taste the couscous, and add a little salt if desired.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transfer about half of the couscous to the steamer basket.</p>
                <p>Again, try to handle the couscous lightly and avoid packing</p>
                <p>it into the steamer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the squash, zucchini, and sweet potatoes, if using, to</p>
                <p>the couscoussier, and place the steamer basket on top.</p>
                <p>(Again, seal the joint if necessary.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you see the steam rise through the couscous,</p>
                <p>carefully add the remaining couscous to the steamer.</p>
                <p>Continue cooking, watching for the steam to rise from the</p>
                <p>couscous. Allow the couscous to steam for a full 15 to 20</p>
                <p>minutes. At this point, all of the vegetables should be</p>
                <p>cooked. Test the vegetables to be sure, cooking longer if</p>
                <p>necessary. Taste the broth—it should be salty and peppery</p>
                <p>—and adjust the seasoning if desired.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving the Couscous and Vegetables:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Empty the couscous into the large bowl, and break it apart.</p>
                <p>Mix in the 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 ladles of broth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To serve the couscous, shape it into a mound with a well in</p>
                <p>the center. Put the meat into the well, and arrange the</p>
                <p>vegetables on top and all around. Distribute the broth</p>
                <p>evenly over the couscous and vegetables, reserving one or</p>
                <p>two bowlfuls to offer on the side for those who prefer</p>
                <p>more.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
