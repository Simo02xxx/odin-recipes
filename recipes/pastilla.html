    <h2>Description:</h2>
    Pastilla, or bastilla, is a Moroccan pie, which looks dead <br>
    impressive but is surprisingly easy to make. It doesn't <br>
    matter if it’s not that neat – we like rustic. We used <br>
    pistachio nuts when we cooked this in Fez for our telly <br>
    show, but the locals prefer almonds. The choice is <br>
    yours.
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4–6 boneless chicken thighs (about 750g)</li>
        <li>10g butter</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>pinch of saffron</li>
        <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>75g ground almonds or pistachios</li>
        <li>75g dried dates, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp orange blossom water</li>
        <li>1 tsp orange zest</li>
        <li>4 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the chicken and fry <br>
            it skin-side down, until crisped up and brown. Turn the <br>
            thighs over and cook for a couple more minutes, then <br>
            remove them from the pan. Add the butter to the pan <br>
            and when it has melted, add the onions and fry them <br>
            gently until soft. Add the garlic and spices and fry for a <br>
            couple more minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken back in the pan and pour in the stock <br>
            or 500ml of water. Season, then cover the pan and simmer <br>
            for about half an hour or until the chicken is tender. <br>
            Remove the chicken and set it aside. When it is <br>
            cool enough to handle, finely chop the meat – it’s up to <br>
            you whether you keep the skin or not. Put the liquid <br>
            back over the heat and reduce it by half.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the cooking liquid and continue to cook <br>
            over a low heat until you have a mixture that resembles <br>
            loose scrambled eggs. Add the ground nuts and stir, <br>
            then add the dates, orange blossom water, zest <br>
            and finally, the chicken. Remove the pan from the heat <br>
            and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. To <br>
            assemble the pie, you need a large ovenproof dish <br>
            about 28cm in diameter.</li>
        <li>Take a sheet of filo pastry and brush it with melted <br>
            butter. Drape it over the dish, making sure it is gently <br>
            pushed into the corners without any tearing. Repeat <br>
            with another sheet of filo, this time placing it at a <br>
            right angle to the first. Repeat with a further 2 sheets of <br>
            filo, this time placing them on the diagonal.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling over the pastry. Fold over the <br>
            overhanging pieces of filo in reverse order – they should <br>
            just about cover the filling. Take the remaining 2 pieces <br>
            of filo and cut them to fit the dish. Brush them <br>
            with butter, then cover the pie, tucking under any <br>
            corners. Bake the pie in the oven for about 30 minutes <br>
            until the pastry is a crisp, golden brown. Remove from <br>
            the oven and allow to cool a little before dusting it with <br>
            the icing sugar and cinnamon.</li>
    </ol>
